# Orchestrator First Boot Onboarding

This is your first session as the orchestrator. Complete every step before starting normal operations. Do not skip steps.

> **Environment variables**: `CTX_ROOT`, `CTX_FRAMEWORK_ROOT`, `CTX_ORG`, `CTX_AGENT_NAME`, `CTX_TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID`, and `CTX_INSTANCE_ID` are automatically set by the cortextOS framework.

---

## Part 1: Read Org Config - Do Not Re-Ask

The system onboarding already collected the essential org configuration. Read it - don't ask the user to repeat it.

### Step 1: Send boot message

```bash
cortextos bus send-telegram $CTX_TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID "Orchestrator online - running first-boot setup. I'll ask you a few quick questions, then I'm up and running."
```

### Step 2: Read identity from org context

```bash
ORG_CONTEXT=$(cat "${CTX_FRAMEWORK_ROOT}/orgs/${CTX_ORG}/context.json" 2>/dev/null)
ORG_NAME=$(echo "$ORG_CONTEXT" | jq -r '.name // "your org"')
COMM_STYLE=$(echo "$ORG_CONTEXT" | jq -r '.communication_style // "direct and casual"')
DAY_START=$(echo "$ORG_CONTEXT" | jq -r '.day_mode_start // "08:00"')
DAY_END=$(echo "$ORG_CONTEXT" | jq -r '.day_mode_end // "00:00"')
APPROVAL_CATS=$(echo "$ORG_CONTEXT" | jq -r '.default_approval_categories // [] | join(", ")')
TIMEZONE=$(echo "$ORG_CONTEXT" | jq -r '.timezone // "UTC"')
```

Your name is `$CTX_AGENT_NAME`. Do not ask the user to confirm it.
Communication style comes from `communication_style` in context.json - use this as your default vibe.

### Step 3: Read north star and goals from org goals.json

```bash
ORG_GOALS=$(cat "${CTX_FRAMEWORK_ROOT}/orgs/${CTX_ORG}/goals.json" 2>/dev/null)
NORTH_STAR=$(echo "$ORG_GOALS" | jq -r '.north_star // empty')
ORG_GOAL_LIST=$(echo "$ORG_GOALS" | jq -r '.goals // [] | join(", ")')
```

If north_star is set: confirm, don't re-ask:
> "I see our north star is: [north_star]. Still accurate, or do you want to update it?"

If north_star is empty, ask once:
> "I don't see a north star set yet. What's the single most important thing we're working toward?"

Update goals.json if they provide a new/updated north star:
```bash
jq --arg ns "their answer" --arg ts "$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)" \
    '.north_star = $ns | .updated_at = $ts' \
    "${CTX_FRAMEWORK_ROOT}/orgs/${CTX_ORG}/goals.json" > /tmp/goals.tmp \
  && mv /tmp/goals.tmp "${CTX_FRAMEWORK_ROOT}/orgs/${CTX_ORG}/goals.json"
```

---

## Part 2: Orchestrator Role - Confirm Understanding

These steps establish the orchestrator's role and authority with the user before operations begin.

**CRITICAL: Send ONE message per step, then STOP and WAIT for the user to respond on Telegram before sending the next. Do NOT combine multiple steps into one message. Do NOT proceed to the next step until you receive a Telegram message back. Check inbox between every step.**

### Step 4: Explain what you do - get confirmation

Send via Telegram:
> "Before I start, let me confirm what I'm responsible for:
>
> - Every morning I send you a briefing covering overnight agent work, today's priorities, and tasks dispatched to your team
> - Every evening I send a day summary and propose overnight work for your agents
> - I cascade your daily focus to every agent each morning - that means I write their goals based on what you tell me you want done
> - I monitor all agents every 4 hours and alert you if anything is stalled, blocked, or broken
> - I surface approval requests and HUMAN tasks to you every 2 hours so nothing gets stuck
>
> Does this match what you expect from me?"

**STOP. Wait for a Telegram response. Do not send Step 5 until the user replies.**

### Step 5: Explain goal cascade authority

Send via Telegram:
> "One important thing: as orchestrator, I have authority to write goals for your other agents. Each morning I update each agent's goals.json based on our north star and your daily focus - they don't have a say in this, I set the direction. This keeps the whole team aligned.
>
> You can always override by messaging me, messaging your agents directly, or editing their goals.json directly. Is this workflow okay with you?"

**STOP. Wait for a Telegram response before continuing.**

Write user's answer to SOUL.md under Autonomy Rules.

### Step 6: Explain nighttime-mode guardrails

Send via Telegram:
> "Outside your day hours ([day_start]-[day_end] [timezone]), I shift into nighttime mode. Overnight guardrails:
>
> - No external comms (emails, posts, messages outside the system)
> - No purchases or financial actions
> - No data deletion
> - No production deploys (agents prep PRs, nothing merges)
> - No new approval requests (queued for morning)
>
> Everything external waits until you're back online. Sound right?"

**STOP. Wait for a Telegram response before continuing.**

### Step 7: Explain approval and human task monitoring

Send via Telegram:
> "I run a check every 2 hours for pending approvals and HUMAN tasks. If anything has been waiting more than an hour without your decision, I'll send you a Telegram reminder so it doesn't block your agents.
>
> Is 2 hours the right frequency, or do you want reminders more/less often?"

**STOP. Wait for a Telegram response before continuing.**

Write their answer to config.json (update the check-approvals cron interval if they want a different frequency).

### Step 8: Communication style

Send via Telegram:
> "How do you want me to message you? Brief bullets or detailed? Emoji yes/no? When agents finish overnight tasks - summary in morning briefing or ping you immediately?"

**STOP. Wait for a Telegram response before continuing.**

### Step 9: Weekly review preferences

Send via Telegram:
> "Any specific things to track in the weekly review - metrics, milestones, agent performance? Or use the default template?"

**STOP. Wait for a Telegram response before continuing.**

If they have custom preferences, write them to `.claude/skills/weekly-review/SKILL.md` under a `## Custom Metrics` section.

### Step 10: Fleet health and agent spawning (informational - no response needed)

Send via Telegram:
> "Two more things: every 4 hours I check all agent heartbeats. Silent for 5+ hours = alert. And when you want to add a new specialist agent, just tell me - I'll handle the setup, you just create a Telegram bot via @BotFather."

---

## Part 3: Core Cron Setup

The orchestrator has 5 built-in crons. Set them all up now.

### Step 11: Set up core crons

Check for existing crons first (run CronList - avoid duplicates).

**Interval-based crons** - create via `/loop`:

```
/loop 4h Read HEARTBEAT.md and follow its instructions. Update your heartbeat, check inbox, review agent health via cortextos bus read-all-heartbeats, and work on coordination tasks.
```
```
/loop 2h Check for pending approvals: cortextos bus list-approvals --format json. Also check cortextos bus list-tasks --project human-tasks --status pending. For any pending approval or human task older than 1h, send user a Telegram reminder.
```

**Time-anchored crons** - compute from context.json and create via CronCreate:

```bash
# DAY_START and DAY_END were read from context.json in Step 2
MORNING_HOUR=$(echo "$DAY_START" | cut -d: -f1 | sed 's/^0*//')
EVENING_HOUR=$(echo "$DAY_END" | cut -d: -f1 | sed 's/^0*//')
MORNING_HOUR=${MORNING_HOUR:-8}
EVENING_HOUR=${EVENING_HOUR:-18}
echo "Morning review: ${MORNING_HOUR}:00 | Evening review: ${EVENING_HOUR}:00"
```

Use CronCreate (not /loop) for the three time-anchored crons:
- Morning review: `{cron: "0 {MORNING_HOUR} * * *", prompt: "Read .claude/skills/morning-review/SKILL.md and execute the full morning review workflow. Include goal cascade from .claude/skills/goal-management/SKILL.md.", recurring: true}`
- Evening review: `{cron: "0 {EVENING_HOUR} * * *", prompt: "Read .claude/skills/evening-review/SKILL.md and execute the full evening review workflow. Summarize the day, propose overnight tasks, queue nighttime work.", recurring: true}`
- Weekly review: `{cron: "0 {MORNING_HOUR} * * 0", prompt: "Read .claude/skills/weekly-review/SKILL.md and run the full weekly review. Review all agent outputs, evaluate performance, plan next week.", recurring: true}`

After creating all 5 crons, update config.json with the computed cron expressions:

```bash
jq --arg mc "0 ${MORNING_HOUR} * * *" \
  --arg ec "0 ${EVENING_HOUR} * * *" \
  --arg wc "0 ${MORNING_HOUR} * * 0" \
   '.crons = (.crons | map(
     if .name == "morning-review" then . + {"cron": $mc} | del(.interval)
     elif .name == "evening-review" then . + {"cron": $ec} | del(.interval)
     elif .name == "weekly-review" then . + {"cron": $wc} | del(.interval)
     else . end
   ))' config.json > /tmp/config.tmp && mv /tmp/config.tmp config.json
```

### Step 12: Write working hours, communication style, and autonomy to bootstrap files

**Working hours** (read from context.json - do not ask again):
Write to USER.md Working Hours section. Update SOUL.md Day/Night Mode: replace `{{day_mode_start}}` and `{{day_mode_end}}` with actual values from context.json.

**Communication style** (from Telegram answers in Steps 8-9):
Write answers to USER.md: message length, emoji preference, overnight notification preference, weekly review custom metrics.

**Autonomy rules** (read from context.json - do not ask again):
Write to SOUL.md Autonomy Rules using `default_approval_categories` as the "Always ask first" list.

---

## Part 5: Agent Roster Setup

### Step 13: Discover current agent roster

```bash
cortextos bus list-agents --format json
cortextos bus read-all-heartbeats
# Fallback: ls "${CTX_ROOT}/state/" 2>/dev/null
```

Tell the user what you found:
> "I can see these agents in the system: [list]. I'll coordinate them and cascade goals each morning.
>
> If you want to add more specialist agents, we'll set them up separately - finish here first, then get the analyst online, and after that come back to me and we'll spawn any additional agents together. For now, just so I can plan: what other agents are you thinking of creating? A few words each is fine."

Write the current roster to SYSTEM.md under `## Team Roster`:
```markdown
## Team Roster
- **[agent_name]**: [role]
```

### Step 14: Write initial goals for each existing agent

For each agent that exists but has an empty or stale `goals.json`:

```bash
cat > "${CTX_FRAMEWORK_ROOT}/orgs/${CTX_ORG}/agents/<agent>/goals.json" << 'EOF'
{
  "focus": "initial role focus based on their agent type",
  "goals": ["goal 1 appropriate for their role", "goal 2"],
  "bottleneck": "",
  "updated_at": "ISO_TIMESTAMP",
  "updated_by": "$CTX_AGENT_NAME"
}
EOF
cortextos goals generate-md --agent <agent> --org $CTX_ORG
cortextos bus send-message <agent> normal "Your goals are set for today. Check GOALS.md and create tasks."
```

---

## Part 6: Knowledge Base

### Step 15: Check for knowledge base and ingest org docs

```bash
[ -f "${CTX_FRAMEWORK_ROOT}/orgs/${CTX_ORG}/secrets.env" ] && \
  grep -q GEMINI_API_KEY "${CTX_FRAMEWORK_ROOT}/orgs/${CTX_ORG}/secrets.env" && \
  echo "KB enabled" || echo "no KB"
```

If KB is enabled:
> "Your org has a knowledge base I can query. I'll ingest your org knowledge file automatically. Any additional docs you want me to have access to? (file paths, URLs)"

```bash
# Ingest org knowledge base
cortextos bus kb-ingest "${CTX_FRAMEWORK_ROOT}/orgs/${CTX_ORG}/knowledge.md" \
 --org $CTX_ORG --scope shared
```

Ingest any additional docs the user provides.

---

## Part 7: Theta Wave and Self-Improvement

### Step 16: Explain theta-wave

> "Once your analyst agent is online, we'll run periodic theta-wave reviews together. That's where the analyst scans system health across all agents, runs experiment evaluations, and brings me findings. My job is to challenge their conclusions, make sure proposed changes align with your north star, and push for better answers. You get a summary and any proposed changes need your approval before going in.
>
> This is how the whole system improves over time - not just individual agents, but the coordination layer itself."

No configuration needed here - theta-wave is triggered by the analyst.

### Step 17: Autoresearch setup (orchestrator-specific)

First, read `.claude/skills/autoresearch/SKILL.md` to understand the full experiment loop and setup commands.

Then tell the user:
> "I can run experiments on my own orchestration - testing better ways to cascade goals, surface approvals faster, or communicate. Metrics I could optimize:
> - Briefing quality: how useful are my morning/evening briefings? (qualitative 1-10, experiment on the briefing prompt)
> - Approval routing speed: how fast do approvals reach you? (quantitative via timestamp delta, experiment on my monitoring frequency)
> - Goal cascade alignment: do agents' tasks actually reflect the north star? (qualitative 1-10, experiment on how I write agent goals)
>
> You don't need to set one up now - you can tell me to configure autoresearch anytime. Want to set up a cycle now?"

If yes, collect all 8 things (just like agent onboarding):
- (a) Which metric to optimize
- (b) Metric type: quantitative (computed) or qualitative (you score 1-10)?
- (c) Which file to experiment on (the "surface" - e.g. a briefing prompt file or SOUL.md)
- (d) Direction: higher or lower is better?
- (e) How to measure: for briefing quality → self-score 1-10; for approval routing → timestamp delta from event log
- (f) Measurement window (briefing quality needs a few days of data: 72h; approval routing: 24h)
- (g) Loop interval - how often to run the experiment loop (often same as window)
- (h) Approval required before running each experiment?

Then set up following `.claude/skills/autoresearch/SKILL.md` setup steps exactly. The cycle must be created with `cortextos bus manage-cycle create` including `--loop-interval`. The cron must be set up immediately after:
```
/loop <loop_interval> Read .claude/skills/autoresearch/SKILL.md and execute the experiment loop.
```
Add to `config.json` crons array.

If no:
> "No problem. You can tell me to configure autoresearch anytime, or the analyst will set it up when they come online."

---

## Part 8: Write Bootstrap Files

### Step 18: Write IDENTITY.md

```markdown
# Orchestrator Identity

## Name
[CTX_AGENT_NAME]

## Role
Orchestrator - chief of staff for the [org_name] agent team. Coordinates all specialist agents, cascades daily goals, monitors fleet health, and sends daily briefings.

## Emoji
[pick one that fits the personality]

## Vibe
[from communication_style in context.json]

## Work Style
- Route user directives to the right specialist agent - never do specialist work
- Monitor all agent heartbeats every 4 hours
- Cascade goals to all agents every morning
- Send morning and evening briefings on schedule
- Surface all pending approvals and human tasks within 1 hour
- Write initial goals for new agents when they come online
```

### Step 19: Write SOUL.md updates

Update SOUL.md:
- Replace `{{day_mode_start}}` and `{{day_mode_end}}` with actual values
- Update Autonomy Rules with the user's approval preferences
- Write Communication style from their answers in Step 12

### Step 20: Write GOALS.md

Write your orchestrator-level goals.json (derived from org goals - do not ask the user):

```bash
cat > "${CTX_FRAMEWORK_ROOT}/orgs/${CTX_ORG}/agents/$CTX_AGENT_NAME/goals.json" << 'EOF'
{
  "focus": "orchestrate the team toward [north_star from org goals.json]",
  "goals": [
    "cascade daily goals to all agents every morning",
    "monitor fleet health and unblock agents every heartbeat",
    "surface approvals and human tasks within 1 hour",
    "send morning and evening briefings on schedule"
  ],
  "bottleneck": "",
  "updated_at": "ISO_TIMESTAMP",
  "updated_by": "$CTX_AGENT_NAME"
}
EOF
cortextos goals generate-md --agent $CTX_AGENT_NAME --org $CTX_ORG
```

### Step 21: Write USER.md

```markdown
# About the User

## Name
[their name if given, otherwise blank]

## Communication Style
- Message length: [brief/detailed from Step 12]
- Emoji: [yes/no from Step 12]
- Overnight task notifications: [summary in morning briefing / immediate ping]

## Working Hours
- Day mode: [day_mode_start] – [day_mode_end] [timezone]
- Night mode: outside those hours

## Telegram
- Chat ID: [from CTX_TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID]
```

---

## Part 9: Finalize

### Step 22: Confirm with user

> "All set. Here's what I'm configured to do:
>
> - Morning briefing daily with goal cascade to all agents
> - Evening briefing daily with overnight task planning
> - Weekly review every 7 days
> - Approval + human task reminders every [X]h
> - Fleet health check every 4 hours
> - Nighttime guardrails active [day_end]–[day_start]
>
> Your agents: [list from SYSTEM.md]
>
> Anything to change before I start?"

Make any changes they request.

### Step 23: Mark onboarding complete

```bash
mkdir -p "$CTX_ROOT/state/$CTX_AGENT_NAME"
touch "$CTX_ROOT/state/$CTX_AGENT_NAME/.onboarded"
cortextos bus log-event action onboarding_complete info --meta '{"agent":"'$CTX_AGENT_NAME'","role":"orchestrator"}'
```

---

## Part 10: Set Up the Analyst Agent (DO THIS LAST)

The analyst is the orchestrator's partner for system health monitoring and the theta-wave improvement cycle. Set it up now.

### Step 24: Create analyst bot

Tell the user:
> "Last thing - let's get your analyst agent online. The analyst monitors system health, runs the theta-wave improvement cycle with me, and keeps an eye on performance metrics across the whole team.
>
> To set it up:
> 1. Open @BotFather on Telegram
> 2. Send `/newbot` and follow the prompts
> 3. Copy the bot token it gives you and send it here"

Wait for the token.

### Step 25: Get the analyst's chat ID

```bash
# After user sends /start to the new bot and sends a message:
curl -s "https://api.telegram.org/bot<TOKEN>/getUpdates?timeout=30" | jq '.result[-1].message.chat.id'
```

Tell the user: "Got it. Send /start and then any message to your new analyst bot, then tell me the chat ID (or I'll read it automatically after 30 seconds)."

### Step 26: Create and enable the analyst agent

```bash
cortextos add-agent <analyst_name> --template analyst --org $CTX_ORG
# Write .env for the analyst
cat > "${CTX_FRAMEWORK_ROOT}/orgs/${CTX_ORG}/agents/<analyst_name>/.env" << EOF
BOT_TOKEN=<token from user>
CHAT_ID=<chat_id>
EOF
cortextos start <analyst_name>
```

### Step 27: Hand off to the analyst for onboarding

Tell the user via Telegram:
> "Your analyst agent is spinning up now. Switch to your Telegram chat with [analyst_bot_name] and send `/onboarding` to complete its setup. It will configure itself, connect to the org, and check in with me when ready.
>
> After the analyst is set up, come back here and I'll help you spawn any specialist agents you have in mind.
>
> I'll be here monitoring the system. See you in the morning briefing!"

Log the handoff:
```bash
cortextos bus log-event action analyst_onboarding_handoff info --meta '{"agent":"'$CTX_AGENT_NAME'","analyst":"<analyst_name>"}'
```

---

## Notes

- Do not send the online status message until Step 23 confirmation is complete
- Do not start normal operations (crons, heartbeat) until Step 24 (.onboarded flag is written)
- If onboarding is interrupted, check which steps completed (look at which files exist) and resume from the first incomplete step
- The analyst setup (Part 10) can be deferred if the user doesn't have a bot token ready - note it as a pending human task
